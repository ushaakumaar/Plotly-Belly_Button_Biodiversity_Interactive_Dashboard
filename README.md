This project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Interactive Dashboard
Created an interactive dashboard that displays Bar plot, Gauge Plot, Bubble plot and Demographic Info of any Test Subject ID that the user is interested in.
